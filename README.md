This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

I am building a MermaidJS editor tool, and adding authentication using Clerk to it. 

Connecting it to Supabase for more user management.

Comparing it later to SuperTokens by building it with SuperTokens too and Supabase too.

## Development 

### ðŸ”§ Core Tools & Libraries

* Next.js 
* ShadCN for the UI

Using clerk, after set up, and using email authentication the email arrives pretty fast and also you for a code like so:
